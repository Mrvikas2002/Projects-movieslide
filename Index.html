            <p>Titanic is a 1997 American disaster film directed, written, produced, and co-edited by James Cameron. <br> James Cameron's "Titanic" is an epic, action-packed romance set against the ill-fated maiden voyage of the R.M.S.

She was the most luxurious liner of her era -- the "ship of dreams" -- which ultimately carried over 1,500 people to their death in the ice cold waters of the North Atlantic in the early hours of April 15, 1912.</p>
